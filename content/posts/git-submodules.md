# Git Submodules

When I tried a customized Hugo theme for my blog, I thought it would be mostly straightforward. But the challenges of Git submodules made themselves known. 

## The Challenge

### Identifying the Problem
While using the Etch theme, I noticed the site description was conspicuously absent. I decided to get my hands dirty and modify the theme directly.

### Forking and Modifying the Theme
I already forked my own repo of the Etch theme and made the necessary tweaks. Testing it locally, everything seemed perfect. However, when pushing the changes to Github, I ran into a new and unfamiliar problem.

### Git Submodules 101
Git submodules are a method to house one Git repository inside another. They’re particularly handy for situations like this – where you want to include a theme or plugin within your project without melding the two histories.

## The Missteps

### Submodule Detachment
I quickly learned the consequences of direct modifications: my submodule detached itself from its source. What seemed like a tiny adjustment led to a confusing situation where my theme pointed to a non-existent link.

### Reconnecting the Dots
The real challenge was making sense of the detached submodule. The `.gitmodules` file was useful, ensuring everything pointed to the right path, which it was not. Instead, it was pointing to a non-existent repo. I knew I just needed to start over.

## The Solution

### Using Git Force
I was certain that the themes/etch-dracula directory was the correct repository and I simply wanted to update or reset it, so I turned to the `--force` option. This powerful Git command allowed me to re-align my theme. However, a word of caution: it's a tool that should be used with understanding and care. I exercised neither.

### Re-adding the Submodule
After some tinkering, I managed to re-add the submodule correctly. The key was pushing both my main repository and the submodule, ensuring they were synchronized and harmonious.
