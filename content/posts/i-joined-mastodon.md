# Why I Joined Mastodon: A Breath of Fresh Air

I found myself growing increasingly discontent with the state of social media platforms (So much so that I learned Hugo and started this blog). The once-familiar landscape had transformed into something different, and not necessarily in a positive way. That's when I decided to join Mastodon, and I'm already enjoying the change. Here are the two main reasons that led me to make the switch:

## 1. Escape from the Strange Vibes on the Bird Site

Twitter used to be a place of lively discussions and information sharing. However, something had changed. The platform had become inundated with strange ads and I often found myself constantly bombarded with questionable content designed to provoke anger and engagement.

This constant stream of negativity was taking a toll on my mental health. I longed for a more peaceful and focused online experience. Mastodon, with its decentralized nature and community-driven ethos, offered a refreshing alternative. (I have also been checking out nostr for some time, but thats another post.)

## 2. A Haven for Linux and Tech Enthusiasts

As a Linux and tech enthusiast, I was on the hunt for a platform where I could find like-minded individuals and engage in discussions related to my interests. Mastodon proved to be the perfect solution. Unlike other platforms, it doesn't employ algorithms designed to incite anger or distraction. Instead, I can explore a wide array of Linux and tech-related content without being sidetracked by irrelevant posts.

### My Mastodon Journey So Far

I've been thoroughly enjoying the discovery phase. If you're interested in Linux, tech, or just want to be part of a more positive online community, feel free to [follow me on Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@alexpareja).
