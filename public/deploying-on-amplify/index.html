<h1 id="deploying-this-site-on-aws">Deploying This Site on AWS</h1>
<p>My journey and the challenges I faced while deploying my blog using the Hugo framework on AWS Amplify.</p>
<h2 id="the-dns-resolution">The DNS Resolution</h2>
<p>While the process seemed straightforward initially, I ran into an unexpected issue: the CNAME records wouldn&rsquo;t resolve. For those unfamiliar, CNAME records are for mapping custom domains to the provided AWS URL. I anxiously waited, tested, and retried, but it appeared stagnant.</p>
<p>Patience proved to be the remedy. Approximately 24 hours later, the domain started functioning as intended. This was a reminder that DNS resolutions aren&rsquo;t always instantaneous and sometimes require a longer waiting period.</p>
<h2 id="the-blank-screen">The Blank Screen</h2>
<p>After overcoming the DNS resolution issue, a new problem presented itself. Upon visiting the provided AWS URL, all I was greeted with was a blank screen. No error messages, no content, just emptiness.</p>
<p>After some investigation, I found the problem in the Hugo configuration file. The <code>baseUrl</code> parameter was pointing towards my custom URL, which at the time, had unresolved DNS records. By switching the <code>baseUrl</code> to the AWS assigned URL temporarily, the site started deploying correctly.</p>
<h2 id="wrapping-it-up">Wrapping It Up</h2>
<p>After ensuring the site was deploying as intended, I waited for the DNS resolution to complete fully. Once it did, I switched the <code>baseUrl</code> back to my custom domain.</p>
<p>A couple of valuable lessons in patience and the importance of double-checking configuration files.</p>
