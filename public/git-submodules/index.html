<h1 id="git-submodules">Git Submodules</h1>
<p>When I tried a customized Hugo theme for my blog, I thought it would be mostly straightforward. But the challenges of Git submodules made themselves known.</p>
<h2 id="the-challenge">The Challenge</h2>
<h3 id="identifying-the-problem">Identifying the Problem</h3>
<p>While using the Etch theme, I noticed the site description was conspicuously absent. I decided to get my hands dirty and modify the theme directly.</p>
<h3 id="forking-and-modifying-the-theme">Forking and Modifying the Theme</h3>
<p>I already forked my own repo of the Etch theme and made the necessary tweaks. Testing it locally, everything seemed perfect. However, when pushing the changes to Github, I ran into a new and unfamiliar problem.</p>
<h3 id="git-submodules-101">Git Submodules 101</h3>
<p>Git submodules are a method to house one Git repository inside another. They’re particularly handy for situations like this – where you want to include a theme or plugin within your project without melding the two histories.</p>
<h2 id="the-missteps">The Missteps</h2>
<h3 id="submodule-detachment">Submodule Detachment</h3>
<p>I quickly learned the consequences of direct modifications: my submodule detached itself from its source. What seemed like a tiny adjustment led to a confusing situation where my theme pointed to a non-existent link.</p>
<h3 id="reconnecting-the-dots">Reconnecting the Dots</h3>
<p>The real challenge was making sense of the detached submodule. The <code>.gitmodules</code> file was useful, ensuring everything pointed to the right path, which it was not. Instead, it was pointing to a non-existent repo. I knew I just needed to start over.</p>
<h2 id="the-solution">The Solution</h2>
<h3 id="using-git-force">Using Git Force</h3>
<p>I was certain that the themes/etch-dracula directory was the correct repository and I simply wanted to update or reset it, so I turned to the <code>--force</code> option. This powerful Git command allowed me to re-align my theme. However, a word of caution: it&rsquo;s a tool that should be used with understanding and care. I exercised neither.</p>
<h3 id="re-adding-the-submodule">Re-adding the Submodule</h3>
<p>After some tinkering, I managed to re-add the submodule correctly. The key was pushing both my main repository and the submodule, ensuring they were synchronized and harmonious.</p>
