<h1 id="why-i-joined-mastodon-a-breath-of-fresh-air">Why I Joined Mastodon: A Breath of Fresh Air</h1>
<p>I found myself growing increasingly discontent with the state of social media platforms (So much so that I learned Hugo and started this blog). The once-familiar landscape had transformed into something different, and not necessarily in a positive way. That&rsquo;s when I decided to join Mastodon, and I&rsquo;m already enjoying the change. Here are the two main reasons that led me to make the switch:</p>
<h2 id="1-escape-from-the-strange-vibes-on-the-bird-site">1. Escape from the Strange Vibes on the Bird Site</h2>
<p>Twitter used to be a place of lively discussions and information sharing. However, something had changed. The platform had become inundated with strange ads and I often found myself constantly bombarded with questionable content designed to provoke anger and engagement.</p>
<p>This constant stream of negativity was taking a toll on my mental health. I longed for a more peaceful and focused online experience. Mastodon, with its decentralized nature and community-driven ethos, offered a refreshing alternative. (I have also been checking out nostr for some time, but thats another post.)</p>
<h2 id="2-a-haven-for-linux-and-tech-enthusiasts">2. A Haven for Linux and Tech Enthusiasts</h2>
<p>As a Linux and tech enthusiast, I was on the hunt for a platform where I could find like-minded individuals and engage in discussions related to my interests. Mastodon proved to be the perfect solution. Unlike other platforms, it doesn&rsquo;t employ algorithms designed to incite anger or distraction. Instead, I can explore a wide array of Linux and tech-related content without being sidetracked by irrelevant posts.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been thoroughly enjoying the discovery phase. If you&rsquo;re interested in Linux, tech, or just want to be part of a more positive online community, feel free to <a href="https://mastodon.social/@alexpareja">follow me on Mastodon</a>.</p>
